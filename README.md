# Starter test framework for RESTful CRUDL apps

## Motivation
When someone is learning to program, or learning a new language, they may start with a simple RESTful CRUDL application like a todo list.
This is intended as a test suite to validate such a server.  While it's written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) it can target a server written in any language.

## Usage

```
npm install
APPURL=http://localhost:8001/items npm test
```
